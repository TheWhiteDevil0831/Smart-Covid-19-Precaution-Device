 # Titile of the Project : 
    SMART COVID-19 PRECAUTION DEVICE
 # Description : 
   This project gives us information about to take precaution towards Covid-19 Out break.The Project or Device contain two main components /sensor
       `1)Ultrasonic sensor and 
       2)Temperature sensor.`
	           The Ultasonic sensor is placed Beside the door of our home ,if any person is crosses that Utrasonic sensor , It  detect and immediately sends a Whatsapp message to our mobile phones i.e 
`“ ALERT!!!!!!!!   Someone is outside your door. Please tell him to clean his hands with sanitizer kept there and touch the temperature sensor ”.` when ower see the message he has to tell the person to touch the temperature sensor and check his/her body temperature. If the person body temperature is more then the normal body temperature
Then one more Whatsapp message is sent to owner regarding his temperature measurement i.e
 `“ALERT!!!!!!!!  The person's body temperature is not normal He has Fever 
TEMPERATURE = xx.xx'F “.`
	Now the owner has to take few precaution measure like wearing mask ,washing hands often ,using sanitizer,social distancing etc. The person may affected or may not be, but we need to take precaution everytime.
Hence this device helps us to detect the temperature of preson (regarding he/she is well or unwell) and we can take precaution in advance.
The Covid-19 is very dangerous and viral infection so we need to take precaution in advance like social distancing ,wearing mask etc .

 # Process Flow
   
    The “ PROCESS FLOW “ of the project is given above ,and its illustrate in steps, the steps are as follows
    STEP1 : when any person pass infront of the  ultra-sonic sensor
    STEP2 : the user will get Whatsapp message that “ ALERT!!!!!!!!   Someone is outside your door. Please tell 
    him to clean his hands with sanitizer kept there and touch the temperature sensor ”.
    STEP3 : By manually telling to  “touch the temperature sensor”
    STEP4 : If that person`s temperature is not normal Then owner gets next alert message as 
    “ALERT!!!!!!!!  The person`s body temperature is not normal He has Fever 
    TEMPERATURE = xx.xx`F “.
